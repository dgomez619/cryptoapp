error made when not installing react-router-dom. 

//////////

error made when not specifying BrowserRouter as Router in the SRC index.js file. 
cope of error thrown "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')"

////////////////

error thrown when using SWITCH to switch routes, switch is deprecated in reach, had to change to "Routes" importing it from "react-router-dom"
syntax looks like this, not the element attribute inside routes to specify the element, written as an actual element tag. 

            <Routes>
              <Route exact path='/' element={<Homepage />}  /> 
              <Route exact path='/exchanges' element={<Exchanges />} />
              <Route exact path='/cryptocurrencies' element={<Cryptocurrencies />} />
              <Route exact path='/crypto/:coinId' element={<CryptoDetails />} />
              <Route exact path='/news'element={<News />} />
            </Routes>

Using Redux toolkit to fetch real API data. 

///////////////////////

when trying to send data to the redux store after fetching it, there was en error ocurring 

--"middleware for rtk-query api at reducerpath "cryptoapi" has not been added to the store. you must add the middleware for rtk-query to function correctly!"--

after searching online I noticed that the tutorial that I was following did not include a middlewear and the app was function according to the video, but it was not working for me. I found how to include the middle wear on stackoverflow and it worked correctly.
